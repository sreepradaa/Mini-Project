# REAL TIME TRAFFIC VIOLATION DETECTION SYSTEM USING YOLO AND OPENCV
Traffic violations, such as riding without helmets or driving without seatbelts, are contributory factors of road accidents and fatalities, and hence, real-time monitoring enforcement systems should be established. This project introduces a real-time traffic violation monitoring system using the YOLOv8 object detection model and OpenCV image processing. The system utilises the YOLOv8 model to detect violations such as a motorcycle rider without a helmet, or a person in a car without a seatbelt, and employs Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) to collect vehicle license plates for enforcement purposes. Pre-processing techniques such as frame skip and adaptive thresholding are used to provide optimal frame capture and best distinguish the number plate in different environments. EasyOCR is also used to improve the performance of ANPR in number plate text extraction. The system accurately detects violations with high precision and recall and is able to operate in real-time. The real-time performance has been validated with a wide variety of images and videos that are collected in some alternative capturing conditions like light and weather. The violation detection system features a user-friendly interface using Streamlit to display detected violations, license plates and confidence metrics. The solution is adaptable and can be scaled and used today as part of a smart city initiative, or similar traffic safety improvement purposes. This work demonstrates the efficacy of combining YOLOv8 and OpenCV for real-time traffic monitoring, addressing critical challenges in automated violation detection.
